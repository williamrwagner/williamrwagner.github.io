**Professional**

I have extensive experience in financial management in diverse industries including technology, software, 
manufacturing, consumer products, internet services and marketing services. 
I found particular enjoyment consulting with start-ups and early stage businessees on business plans, 
and operations.  

I hold degrees in Financial Management from MIT (MS) and Aeronautical Engineering from MIT (BS)

**Personal**

My wife, Susan, and I have been married for 35 years and have two sons, Gregory and Andrew.
They were raised in Wellesley. 
Our careers took us to several locations in MA, CA, CT, NY and NJ but we wanted to settle on the North Shore, 
having been frequent visitors to Rockport since the late 60's.

Rockport's seaside venue offers a lot of outdoor opportunities that our family enjoys. You can 
find me on the many trails in Dogtown where I run and walk frequently and where I participate in the Ted Tarr 
memorial hikes on Sunday mornings.

We also love hiking the White Mountains where we have summitted all 48 peaks over 4,000 ft in elevation.
