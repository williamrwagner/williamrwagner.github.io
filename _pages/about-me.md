**Professional**

I have extensive experience in financial management in a diverse industries including technology, software, 
manufacturing, consumer products, internet services and marketing services. 
I found particular enjoyment consulting with start-ups and early stage businessees on business plans, 
and operations.  

Some well known companies I've worked at include PepsiCo Inc, Dep Corporation, Polaroid, General Scanning Inc and a number 
of other small to mid-size companies.

I hold degrees in Financial Management from MIT (MS) and Aeronautical Engineering from MIT (BS)

**Personal**

My wife, Susan, and I were married on Martha's Vineyard and have two sons, Greg and Andrew.
They were raised principally in Wellesley which was close to our employment and a town with excellent schools. 
Our careers took us to several locations in MA, CA, CT, NY and NJ but we wanted to settle on the north shore, 
having been frequent visitors to Rockport since the late 60's.

Rockport has dramatic ocean and offers a lot of outdoor opportunities that our family enjoys. You can 
find me on the many trails in Dogtown where I run and walk frequently and where I participate in the Ted Tarr 
memorial hikes on Sunday mornings.

We also love hiking the White Mountains where we have summitted all 48 peaks over 4,000 ft in elevation.
