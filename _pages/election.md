who wishes to vote without having to enter a polling venue. 

You can [get your ballot][ballot request form]
at any time but it must be returned by mail to the Town Clerk and received before June 30. For convenience, 
you may also deposit in a special slot at the Town Hall vestibule without having to go inside.
