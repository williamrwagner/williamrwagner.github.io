*SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING VOTING*

Due to health concerns during the Covid-19 epidemic the Town is currently providing early absentee ballots to anyone 
who wishes to vote without having to enter a polling venue. 
To receive your ballot by mail <a href="https://www.rockportma.gov/sites/rockportma/files/news/2020-municipal-early-ballot-application.pdf">**clicking on this link**</a> to the town voting instructions.

You can get your ballot at any time but it must be returned by mail to the Town Clerk and received before June 30. For convenience, 
you may also deposit in a special slot at the Town Hall vestibule without having to go inside.
