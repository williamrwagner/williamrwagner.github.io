title: "I Care About Rockport's Future"
---

The Rockport Town elections will be June 30. I am running for Selectman because I want to do my part to help 
lead Rockport to a vibrant future, particularly as we recover from the terrible effects of COVID. 
I am asking for your support and vote.

My goal is to collaborate with the Selectmen to meet the challenges we will face over the next several years. There are many that have financial ramifications; for example:

*	**Economic Impacts** – We face an uncertain economy from the COVID pandemic; 
our dining, shopping, arts and entertainment businesses are being tested. 
Our Town revenues from the state will be impacted. We need to make the best decisions for all in these uncertain times.

*	**Infrastructure** – Rockport’s infrastructure is suffering from deferred maintenance. These include water/sewer, 
town buildings and roads. Our valued coastal beaches, seawalls and harbors are threatened.

*	**Long Beach** –The beach and property behind the beach are owned by the Town.  The property is leased 
to homeowners and the leases expire at the end of 2023. The Town owes leaseholders and taxpayers 
a plan for new terms at the end of the lease. The condition of the seawall protecting the homes 
is a critical issue with significant financial and environmental considerations.


We need Board members who have diverse skills, a deep understanding of the Town’s operations and financial capacity, 
and, the ability to bring a new approach to solving problems and creating opportunities.  My professional career, 
as well as my service to the town on the Finance Committee, have given me the necessary skills to help meet the challenges  
of the future and expanding the opportunities for the Town to thrive.

My service on the Finance Committee gives me broad knowledge of Town operations and financial challenges. 
I joined the Finance Committee because I wanted to give back to the community and help the management of the 
Town using my financial management experience. I enjoyed my time volunteering. 
I want to further serve the community and believe my experiences will be an asset as Selectman.

My background includes:

*	A career in financial management with large and small companies.

*	Financial management and engineering degrees from MIT 

*	A regular visitor to the North Shore since 1968, a MA resident for 35 years and a Rockport resident for the last 10 years. I am married with 2 adult sons.

I want to join the Board of Selectmen to help preserve Rockport as a wonderful place to live, work and play. 

I am asking for your vote on June 30.
