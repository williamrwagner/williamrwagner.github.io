title: "Working with Neighbors to Chart a Course for the Future"
---

More than a mere tag line, having a Board of Selectmen working with neighbors 
to chart a course for the future is what I deeply believe is needed for the Town to meet the challenges ahead. 
There are immediate challenges dealing with the economic fallout of the pandemic, and there are significant future challenges; 
virtually all have financial implications for the Town and its residents. 
We need a defined course for the future, along with a deep understanding of how to get there, 
and the ability to generate the necessary resources to ensure life in Rockport is the very best for all residents. 

In addition to its executive duties and operations oversight functions, the Selectmen must be the leaders of planning 
for the future by bringing together and integrating the work of the many other Town boards, committees, and commissions. 
It is important that members of the public also have significant input on issues facing the Town.  
I am committed in being a team player with the other Selectmen and collaborating with committees, residents, 
and Town employees to ensure Rockport is a vibrant community serving people of all ages.

We need Board members who have diverse skills, a deep understanding of the Town’s operations and financial capacity, 
and, the ability to bring a new approach to solving problems and creating opportunities.  My professional career, 
as well as my service to the town on the Finance Committee, have given me the necessary skills to help meet the challenges 
and of the future and expanding the opportunities for the Town to thrive.

For all these reasons, I’m running for Selectman and I ask for your vote on or before June 30th.*

I am dedicated to:

* Maintaining a vibrant Downtown for residents and visitors
* Promoting senior and health services
* Supporting an excellent education for all
