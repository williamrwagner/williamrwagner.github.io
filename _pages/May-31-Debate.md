The Cape Ann League of Women Voters hosted a Zoom debate between the five candidates for two open seats on the Board of Selectman 
in Rockport on Sun May 31. During the debate candidates answered 7 questions:

* What was the driving issue causing you to run?
* What should the long term Selectmen policy be for the Long Beach leases?
* Rockport's revenues will be lower next year; what budget cuts would you suggest?
* The School Committee withdrew their override request this year and will bring it up again for next year; are you in favor?
* What infrastructure projects should be prioritized for the next 3 years?
* What would you do to increase affordable housing toward the state goal of 10% and would you support a high density development at the train station?
* What other question would you like to answer?
