What should the long term Selectmen policy be for the Long Beach leases?
Rockport's revenues will be lower next year; what budget cuts would you suggest?
The School Committee withdrew their override request this year and will bring it up again for next year; are you in favor?
What infrastructure projects should be prioritized for the next 3 years?
What would you do to increase affordable housing toward the state goal of 10% and would you support a high density development at the train station?
What other question would you like to answer?
